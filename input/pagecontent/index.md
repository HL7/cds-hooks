<b>Continuous Improvement Build</b>
<br>
This is the continuous integration, community release of the CDS Hooks specification. All stable releases are available at [https://cds-hooks.hl7.org](https://cds-hooks.hl7.org).
</p>

## Overview

This specification describes a
["hook"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooking)-based pattern for invoking
decision support from within a clinician's workflow. The API supports:

 * Synchronous, workflow-triggered CDS calls returning information and suggestions
 * Launching a user-facing SMART app when CDS requires additional interaction
